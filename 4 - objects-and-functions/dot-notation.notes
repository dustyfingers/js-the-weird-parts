objects are a collection of name/value pairs

but how does an object reside in your computers memory?
well, objects can point to primitives or even other objects stored off of it -> we call this a property
or it can point to a function called a method

your base object, the properties and methods it points to and the references (pointers) themselves all have their own address in memory
